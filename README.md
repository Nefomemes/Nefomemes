<li>Familiarity with Lua, however haven't worked on any single Lua project.</li>

<h2>Tehcs I understand</h2>
These are tools, packages, softwares, and services that I understand.

- [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) - A fork of Visual Studio Code with privacy in mind.
- [Replit](https://repl.it/) - Advertises itself as a programming learning environment and RunKit on a larger scale. Works like Glitch as well.
- [Glitch](https://glitch.com) - Like Replit, but more dedicated to Node.js, it's pricing sucks, and how it will reload your Node process when a file have been changed is sucks, even with the `watch.json` config file. I rarely uses it, but dank, it have better UI/UX than Replit.
- [Figma](https://figma.com/) - A website used to design UI/UX. I rarely use this though, not mobile friendly.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) - Do you live under the rock?
- [ESlint](https://eslint.org/) - Lints JS codes.
- [MKdocs](https://mkdocs,org) - Makes documentation websites
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - The ultimate version control.
- [JSdoc](https://jsdoc.app/) - Generate the documentation of a JS library.
- [MongoDB](https://mongodb.org/) - One of the best NoSQL databases ot there.
