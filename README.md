## Projects
These are cool stuffs I have worked on.

- [betterlog-bf4](https://nefomemes.github.io/betterlog-bf4) - An enhanced fork of BF3 BetterBattlelog BF4 theme.
- [WIP] [accounts](https://github,com/Nefomemes/accounts) - Sign in and log in to Nefomemes Network sites with a Nefomemes Network account.
- [Discontinued] [Fortress](https://github.com/Nefomemes/Fortress) - I'm not working on it anymore but in the future I will probably make it a Discord.js framework.

## Static documentations
So, I forked some documentation repos that have sucky CSS and hosted them myself with mkdocs-material as the theme.

- [JSdoc](https://nefomemes.github.io/JSdoc) ([original site](https://jsdoc.app/))
- [PUEBI](https://nefomemes.github.io/puebi) ([original site](https://ivanlanin.github.io/puebi))
